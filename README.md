# Optic-Disc-and-Macula-Recognition-in-Retinal-Images
This project involves the creation of an image processing algorithm in Matlab, specifically a trained segmentation algorithm for the recognition of macula and optic disc in a dataset of retinal images. 

The algorithm is trained on the ARIA Dataset
      - Training with Training-400 images (AMD & Non-AMD).
      
The algorithm is tested on the ARIA Dataset
      - testing with Validation-400 images.
      
For a deep understanding of the code please read first the presentation and then the documentation for more details.
